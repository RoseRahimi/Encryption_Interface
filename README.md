In this mini project, I’ve built a simple interface that makes it easy to work with different encryption models. The goal was to create a flexible setup where I could plug in various cryptographic algorithms, test them, and compare how they work all within the same structure.

So far, I’ve implemented two encryption algorithms: the Caesar cipher, which encrypts messages by shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet, and the Scytale cipher, which uses transposition rather than substitution. Instead of changing the letters themselves, the Scytale cipher rearranges their order by writing the message in rows across a fixed number of columns. If the last row isn’t completely filled, it pads the remaining spaces with blank characters to complete the grid.
