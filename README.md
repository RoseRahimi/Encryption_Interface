In this mini project, I’ve built a simple interface that makes it easy to work with different encryption models. 
The goal was to create a flexible setup where I can plug in various cryptographic algorithms, test them out, and compare how they work all within the same structure. 
It’s a small step toward understanding and experimenting with how data can be securely transformed.
